"""
This is a python script that will process all the images in a directory and 
try to convert them into pyramidal tiff format using the vips image processing
library. The converted images will then be moved into a subdirectory named
"processed" within the specified directory.

Dependencies:
    PIL (python imaging library)
    Python (version < 3.0)
    vips (http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=VIPS)

Usage:
    Either run it with
        python process.py [directory]
    or chmod it to executable (chmod +x process.py) and run it with
        ./process.py directory

Options:
    If you want to resize all the images so that they have the same number
    of zoom levels, add the -r or --resize switch. This is not necessary, 
    but will result in all the images being closer to the same size than 
    processing without the switch.
