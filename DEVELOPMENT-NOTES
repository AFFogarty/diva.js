Development notes
=================

Here are some notes related to the development of the document viewer.

### Console ###

The console is a great developer's tool - just do `console.log("Testing to see if this prints out");` to print debugging statements as you would in other languages. However, some browsers that don't have a console (such as Firefox when Firebug is not opened) may refuse to run the Javascript at all if `console` is referenced, so make sure console is opened if you're doing any debugging. Pretty obvious, but easy to forget.

### JSON-outputting server ###

Some browsers (Firefox, Chrome among them) will not perform an AJAX request if the request is cross-domain. A workaround would be needed (later) to accomplish this. Safari, however, should not have any problems with this.

### DragScrollable plugin ###

To make only the selected element drag-scrollable, set `acceptPropagatedEvents` to false; otherwise, if you want all children of that element (the images, for instance) to be drag-scrollable as well, set `acceptPropagatedEvents` to true.

### Asynchronicity ###

As is obvious from its name, AJAX requests are asynchronous. That means that anything that depends on the request being complete has to be put in the success callback function. For instance, if one wanted to append something to the document (e.g. put an image at the very end of the document) it would have to be put in the success function, probably near the end. If one were to do something like this

	ajaxRequest(2); // call the AJAX request with zoom 2
	doSomethingAfterAjaxRequest(); // call a random method after the AJAX request

then `doSomethingAfterAjaxRequest()` will probably be executed before the AJAX request is even complete, which is not the intended behaviour.

### Extending the jQuery namespace ###

extending jQuery namespace thing, so non-global vars etc, link to blog post

### Data received through AJAX request ###

the information being passed to through the ajax request
	i don't actually use page ID at all
	and the total number of tiles is useless ... get rid of that?
	and the heightAbovePages uses the ID to keep track of the height above each page
		done this way so we don't have to do further calculations to scroll down to a page
		and it means getting the height above the page in O(1) time or whatever
	but by ID i mean the number I assigned it, between 0 to n-1 where n is the number of pages
		during the initial ajax request function crap
